    <p>My Name is Ahmed and I am a student at UMN Coding Bootcamp. Throughout my childhood, I always loved computers but I was afraid of making mistakes and hated going to the library for a computer. We never had a desktop computer until my senior year of high school and I thought it was late to start coding. Thereafter, I decided to pursue Biology and set my eyes for Medical school.  
    
 When I graduated with a degree in Biology, the only entry level job that I found was working at a lab and I hated it. I had to start for hours and perform many repetitive work. I wasn't growing as a person and I didn't like what I was doing. After a few months, I began searching for ways to code and get in the field of Software Development.</p>
    
    <p>Luckily, a few of my friends attended the UMN coding Bootcamp and they encouraged me to research and find out more information about the program. After months of contemplating, I decided to enroll and start my journey. 
    
    My passion for Software pushed me to start my company <a href="https://pioneerswebdesign.com/"> Pioneers Web Design </a> and design websites using Wordpress for businesses. I hope that I can learn new skills and thrive in a world that is driven by technology. </p>
